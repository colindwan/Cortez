TODO List

I'll try to keep a general roadmap of what I think the priorities/unfinished business is.  
Feel free to add notes/items as needed


Mission system - need to add something to track the overall progress of our character, drive events, conversations, etc
Conversations - basic level added, need to figure out the connection between missions and conversations or responding to conversations based on attributes
    - A better conversation editor is needed before we get too much further.
Combat - not even started
Main menu - once we have our mission system in, we'll want some form of saves, new character, etc
Inventory/Equipment
Attributes - NPCs have a very basic form right now but I need to abstract this a little more
